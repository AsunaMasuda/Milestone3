## What does it do and what does it need to fulfill?
This Milestone project creation is the culmination of learning and study from the eight, ninth and tenth modules of the Full Stack Developer Course, Python Fundamentals, Practical Python and Data Centric Development, to create a fully Mobile Responsive CRUD Web Application. This Application will allow a user to create, read, update and delete Olympic Weightlifting Sessions and is called "Oly-Track".

#### Design

##### 1. Font
The project has a main font of <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Maven+Pro">Maven Pro</a> and a secondary font of <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto">Roboto</a> which greatly complement each other throughout the site.
  
“Sans-Serif” is used as the default backup font in cases where these fonts have difficulty loading.
Maven Pro sports a unique curvature allowing it the ability to stand out and be distinguishable when in context. It is used throughout the site as the main font for headers, unique stand-out pieces of information and button text etc, drawing the user’s attention to these main focus points and calls to actions.

The secondary font used is Roboto. With its natural widths per character, and increased effectiveness for reading rhythm, it was the perfect choice using this font for the lengthier text elements. Used on all major paragraphs, it offers a pleasing reading ability to the user and is easy on the eyes. This font is a staple used in many websites and applications today worldwide and is reminiscent of how an application should look, clean, professional and very readable amongst all major languages.

##### 2. Color Scheme
This project went through multiple theme iterations whilst in Wireframe stage. Ultimately, I was always lead back to professional high contrast finish that would normally be seen in most day-to-day apps with a touch of pastel color to highlight to the user the breakaway elements.

* ![#000000](https://placehold.it/15/000000/000000?text=+) `#000000` - Primary color
* ![#aae1db](https://placehold.it/15/aae1db/000000?text=+) `#aae1db` - Secondary color
* ![#545479](https://placehold.it/15/545479/000000?text=+) `#545479` - Tertiary color
* ![#323232](https://placehold.it/15/323232/000000?text=+) `#323232` - Supplementary color #1
* ![#84afa6](https://placehold.it/15/84afa6/000000?text=+) `#84afa6` - Supplementary color #2

The logo was created with a clean black color, ![#000000](https://placehold.it/15/000000/000000?text=+) , setting the immediate tone for the rest of the application to be professional and aesthetically pleasing. All fonts used throughout the application utilise this primary color as-well.

The navbar is colored in our Secondary color choice, ![#aae1db](https://placehold.it/15/aae1db/000000?text=+) , which offered the first splash of vibrant color to contrast the logo and the nav-link elements of black. I screened this against several people and all came back commenting the contrast was fine on their preferred device.

The call to action buttons utilised the same navbar coloring of, ![#aae1db](https://placehold.it/15/aae1db/000000?text=+) , when not active, focused or hovered. When an action was captured on the button, it would turn a slightly darker hue (our supplementary color #2), ![#84afa6](https://placehold.it/15/84afa6/000000?text=+) , to show the user that this element is interact-able and something can happen when pressed.

The tertiary color, ![#545479](https://placehold.it/15/545479/000000?text=+) , was used as a subtle dark-tone to break up the solid abruptness of the black. Throughout the site you can see this is used sparingly to create some dividers and the outlines of the call to action buttons, aswell as create the hover effect on the social iconography in the Footer.

Supplementary color #1, ![#323232](https://placehold.it/15/323232/000000?text=+) , is used as a background color to break up long page, such as the Home page, for the user to distinguish between sections. 

##### 3. Logo
The logo was custom created by myself in photoshop. It incorporates straight leading lines and symmetrical shaping to reinforce the idea and importance of form in Olympic Weightlifting. In conjunction with the above, a vector of a barbell was used to extend and further delineate from a generic logo allowing the user to know at a glance that the application was intended for use with sport in general.

The centre of the logo comprises of a deconstructed hexagon which would be similar in shape and form to a hex-bar used often by Olympic/Power Lifters in accessory style sessions. It was a natural offset to the straight and narrow leading edges of the barbell and gave it a solid sturdy approach, again reinforcing the natural attribute of the sport, strength in a solid base.
